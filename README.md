# CSE378-Final
Ball shooting robot programmed using ROBOTC
The robot performs obstacle avoidance as its navigation method.  It distinguishes intruders from inanimate objects by detecting
movement through its ultrasonic sensor.
final.c currently does not work as the robot fails to accurately identify the direction of sounds that are not continuous.
