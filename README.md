# CSE378-Final
Ball shooting LEGO NXT robot programmed using ROBOTC.
The robot performs obstacle avoidance as its navigation method.  It distinguishes intruders from inanimate objects by detecting
movement through its ultrasonic sensor.
Unfortunately, final.c currently does not work as the robot fails to accurately identify the direction of sounds that are not continuous.
However, the robot can be tested without its sound-sensing functionality using final (no sound).c
Unfortunately, the robot was disassembled after its final demonstration and no footage of it currently exists.
